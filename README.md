Abstract— In this research endeavour, we address the pressing concern of digital image forgery detection by proposing two novel algorithms grounded in distinct methodologies. The first algorithm leverages the logarithmic basis of Benford’s law, asserting uniform distribution of mantissa in the logarithm of practical numbers. Our approach utilizes this principle to analyze the mantissa distribution of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in JPEG images, employing a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The results demonstrate exceptional accuracy in CASIA V1.0 and V2.0 datasets. The second algorithm tackles the challenge of unified detection for splicing and copy-move forgery. By exploiting artifacts from manipulations in JPEGencoded images, we assess changes in the statistical properties of AC components of DCT coefficients. The proposed technique incorporates standard deviation and the count of non-zero DCT coefficients for each AC frequency component independently. Experimental validation on the CASIA V1.0 and V2.0 datasets, both pre-and post-processed, showcases superior detection rates. Through a series of rigorous experiments, we unveil the limitations of these models, showcasing their struggles in cross-dataset evaluations and when confronted with inthe-wild manipulated media. The findings spotlight the discrepancy between reported high performance on specific datasets and the actual performance in diverse, real-world scenarios. This research prompts a reconsideration of evaluation methodologies. It highlights the need for more resilient and adaptable image forgery detection techniques in the face of evolving digital manipulation techniques and varied data distributions.
